# Branches

The repository has these branches and the other brnaches can be deleted as
they might origin from pull requests.

- `master` [→ visit][master-branch]  
  This is the branch we work on to create custom sites, add tutorials and
  style the pages.
  The built branch is served via [GitHub Pages][pages].
- `offline` [→ visit][offline-branch]  
  This is an optional branch which can be used to generate an offline version
  of the website.
- `offline-build` [→ visit][offline-build-branch]  
  To make deployment easy, this branch contains the build website ready to serve.
- `server` [→ visit][server-branch]  
  This branch contains a web server which can serve the `offline-branch` contents.

These are the only branches which should exist in the repository.
If you create a pull request, please, for maintaining a oversight,
[fork the repository][fork] and create a pull-request from a branch in your fork.
You can edit your version and [compare it across forks][compare] to create a
pull request.
