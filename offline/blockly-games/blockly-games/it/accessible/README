Accessible Blockly Music Game
=============================

This game illustrates how to use Accessible Blockly to create a programming
game for blind users.

Accessible Blockly renders a version of the Blockly toolbox and workspace that
is easily keyboard-navigable and is compatible with JAWS/NVDA screen readers on
Firefox for Windows. (We chose to start with these because they are the most
robust screen readers, and are compatible with many more aria tags than other
screen readers.)

Please note that deaf users should continue using Blockly over Accessible
Blockly.


Installation
============
This demo depends on the MIDI.js library, which is automatically downloaded via
the Blockly Games Makefile when you run "make deps".

To set it up locally, you will need to run this game on a server (in order for
MIDI.js to work). One way to do this is to navigate to the parent of the
blockly-games folder, and then run:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

Then, navigate to:

    http://localhost:8888/appengine/accessible/index.html
