This is an introduction site for programming tutorials.
The following use-cases are considered:

- Distribute the web page
  1. [**View the website online**][page]  
     The webpage is served by GitHub pages.
     You can view it online anytime you want. Even after a meeting,
     you can continue to use it at home.
  2. [**Download the website for offline usage**][offline-download]  
     You can distribute it with a USB-Device.
     Some of the tutorials are available offline and visibly marked.
  3. **Distribute the webpage locally**  
     You may install the [offline server][server-branch] on a local computer.
     People can access it without an internet connection.
     With a low-bandwidth internet connection, they can choose a local
     server from the menu and work on local tutorials.
     This frees up the internet connection and speeds up response time.
- Customize your page
  1. **Languages**  
     Sometimes not all participants in a meeting speak the local language.
     Translations are the same for all pages.
     Your page profits from translations others make.
  2. **Flexible structure**  
     Each programming club or meeting can have its own page.
     You can choose from a variety of tutorials and add new ones.

This page is used by the following CoderDojos:

- [CoderDojo Potsdam](potsdam.html)
- [CoderDojo Dahlem](dahlem.html)

If you like to add new pages, translate or change something, [the documentation can help][documentation].
If you have any questions or like to get in touch, [join our chat on gitter][gitter].
This is a beginner-friendly environent where we would like to help you get
started with programming. You can work on [issues][issues] to help us.
